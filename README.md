# Data Analysis and Prediction on Certificate of Entitilement (COE) Prices

## 1. About

This main goal of this project is to analyze the trends and factors that are correlated to the price of COE. With the data given and the trends observed, models are trained to predict the COE Prices for Category A and B vehicles.

### Data used in this project `/data`

1. Results of COE Bidding Exercise <br> `bidding-results.csv`
2. Monthly Motor Vehicle Population <br> `motor-vehicle-population.csv`
3. Monthly New Registration Of Motor Vehicle <br> `new-registraion.csv`
4. Monthly De-registration Of Motor Vehicle <br> `deregistration.csv`
5. Monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Transport <br> `CPI-transport.csv`
